This is my first python project!

This project is used to control a LED STRIP connected through ARDUINO to the pc, and then used serialisation in python to control data.

I used different modules for this like pyaudio, numpy, wave and serial for the arduino to send data to.

This was created for Aerobotix club (INSAT)
